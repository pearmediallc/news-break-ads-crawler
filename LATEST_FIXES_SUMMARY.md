# Latest Fixes Summary - 2025-10-04

## 🔧 All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Authentication Fixed - Main Extraction Page
**Problem:** Extraction wouldn't start - redirected to login

**Solution:**
- Added `authFetch()` helper function with Bearer token
- Includes `credentials: 'include'` for cookie support
- Updated 20+ API endpoints to use authFetch
- Fixed `/api/extract/start`, `/api/sessions/*`, `/api/ads`, `/api/query/*`

**Files:** `public/index.html`
**Commit:** `d4bb9d5`

---

### 2. ✅ Status Panel & Live Logs Always Visible
**Problem:** Status panel and live logs were hidden when no extraction running

**Solution:**
- Removed `hidden` class from status panel HTML
- Status panel now always visible
- Shows "Idle" status when no extraction
- Live logs section always visible with helpful message
- Stop button hidden by default, shows when extraction active

**Files:** `public/index.html` (lines 415-434)
**Commit:** `16811b6`

---

### 3. ✅ Ad Filtering Disabled (Backend)
**Problem:** Too many duplicates being filtered out

**Solution:**
- Commented out duplicate detection in `extractAds.js`
- Commented out sliding window filter in `extractionWorker.js`
- ALL ads are now saved to database
- No more "all duplicates" messages

**Files:**
- `extractAds.js` (lines 878-914)
- `src/services/extractionWorker.js` (lines 577-616)

---

### 4. ✅ Auto-Refresh Dashboard
**Problem:** Had to manually refresh to see new ads

**Solution:**
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- Fetches latest ads in background
- Updates UI when new ads found
- Auto-loads current session on login

**Files:** `public/index.html` (lines 1002-1049)

---

### 5. ✅ Custom Time Range Filter (Viewer Page)
**Problem:** Custom time range filtering wasn't working

**Solution:**
- Added `originalAdsData` to store unfiltered ads
- Filter now uses original data source
- Clear button restores original ads
- Supports timestamp and created_at fields

**Files:** `public/viewer.html` (lines 507, 877-953)

---

### 6. ✅ Live Logs Heading Added
**Problem:** Logs section had no heading - unclear what it was

**Solution:**
- Added "📝 Live Logs" heading above logs container
- Clear visual separation from extraction status

**Files:** `public/index.html` (line 426)

---

### 7. ✅ Frontend Duplicate Filtering Toggle
**Problem:** Duplicates still filtered on frontend

**Solution:**
- Added `SHOW_ALL_ADS = true` flag in SSE handler
- When true, all ads displayed without frontend filtering
- Works with backend filter disabled

**Files:** `public/index.html` (line 775)

## 🔮 Expected Results

When you start a new multi-thread extraction:

1. **Ad Count:** Will be **MUCH HIGHER** (3-5x previous counts)
   - Same ads may appear multiple times
   - No "all duplicates" messages
   - Database grows faster

2. **Live Logs:** Will show in real-time:
   - "✅ Extracted X ads (filtering disabled - showing all)"
   - Each ad listed individually
   - No duplicate filtering logs

3. **Dashboard:** Updates automatically:
   - New ads appear every 5 seconds
   - No manual refresh needed
   - SSE shows real-time updates

4. **Performance:**
   - More database storage needed
   - More frontend memory (more ads)
   - More API calls (auto-refresh)
