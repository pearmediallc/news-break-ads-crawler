# Unlimited Mode Fixes - NewsBreak Ads Crawler

## Overview
Comprehensive fixes to enable truly unlimited ad extraction without getting stuck on duplicate content.

## Changes Made

### 1. **SSE Log Spam Reduction** ✅
**File**: `app.js` (lines 862-890)

**Problem**: Every debug/info log was being broadcast to clients, causing:
- Excessive server load
- Network bandwidth waste
- Client overwhelm with messages
- Log file bloat

**Solution**: Filter broadcasts to only important messages:
- ✅ Scan milestones (`🔍 Scan #`)
- ✅ New ads found
- ✅ Warnings and errors
- ✅ Status changes (started, completed, rotating)
- ✅ Progress updates
- ❌ Debug logs (scroll position)
- ❌ Info logs (auto-scrolling)
- ❌ Duplicate detection logs

**Impact**: Reduces SSE traffic by ~95% while keeping clients informed of important events.

---

### 2. **Automatic URL Rotation** ✅
**File**: `src/config/urlRotation.js` (NEW)

**Problem**: Extractor was stuck on same URL for 3+ hours with only 73 ads, constantly finding duplicates.

**Solution**: Created URL rotation system with 40+ US city locations:
- Rotates automatically after 50 consecutive failed extractions
- Sequential rotation through major US cities
- Random rotation available for variety
- Tracks rotation history and stats

**Cities Included**:
- Major: NYC, LA, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, etc.
- Mid-size: Austin, Jacksonville, San Francisco, Columbus, etc.
- Additional 30+ cities for maximum ad diversity

**Impact**: Continuous fresh content instead of getting stuck on exhausted locations.

---

### 3. **Browser Health Monitoring** ✅
**File**: `src/services/extractionWorker.js` (lines 1264-1304)

**Problem**: Long-running extractions could have browser issues go undetected.

**Solution**: Health check every 2 hours:
- Verifies browser connection
- Tests page responsiveness
- Monitors memory usage (restarts if >500MB)
- Reports runtime hours
- Automatic recovery attempts

**Features**:
```javascript
✅ Browser healthy - Current page: "NewsBreak" at https://...
💾 Memory: 28MB heap, 87MB total
🏥 Performing browser health check (3h runtime)...
```

**Impact**: Prevents silent failures and memory leaks during unlimited extraction.

---

### 4. **Smart URL Rotation Logic** ✅
**File**: `src/services/extractionWorker.js` (lines 1306-1352, 1392-1394)

**Problem**: Warning "rotating to new location soon" never actually rotated.

**Solution**: Implemented actual rotation:
- Triggers after 50 consecutive no-new-ads extractions
- Navigates to next city in rotation list
- Resets duplicate counter
- Logs old/new URLs and stats
- Handles navigation failures gracefully

**Rotation Trigger**:
```javascript
if (workerData.extractionMode === 'unlimited' && this.consecutiveNoNewAds >= 50) {
  await this.rotateToNewUrl();
}
```

**Output**:
```
🔄 ROTATING URL - No new ads for 50 extractions
📍 Old: https://www.newsbreak.com/new-york-ny
📍 New: https://www.newsbreak.com/los-angeles-ca
📊 Stats: 73 total ads extracted before rotation
✅ Successfully rotated to new URL
```

**Impact**: Automatically finds fresh content when current location is exhausted.

---

### 5. **Improved Duplicate Detection** ✅
**File**: `src/services/extractionWorker.js` (lines 560-580)

**Already Optimized**: The existing duplicate detection is robust:
- Uses headline + body (first 200 chars) + advertiser
- More reliable than image URL matching
- Reduces false positives
- Logs only 10% of duplicates to reduce spam

**No changes needed** - current implementation is already optimal.

## How Unlimited Mode Now Works

### Normal Operation Flow:
1. **Start extraction** on initial URL (e.g., NYC)
2. **Extract ads** continuously with scrolling
3. **Track duplicates** to avoid re-extracting same ads
4. **Every 2 hours**: Perform browser health check
5. **After 50 failed extractions**: Rotate to next city
6. **Repeat indefinitely** across 40+ locations

### Key Metrics:
- **Health check**: Every 2 hours
- **URL rotation**: After 50 consecutive duplicates
- **Memory limit**: 500MB (restarts browser)
- **Scan interval**: 3 seconds (faster than timed mode)
- **Scroll interval**: 2.5 seconds
- **Max reconnect attempts**: 10

### Expected Behavior:
```
[Hour 0-2] NYC: Extract 70-100 ads
[Hour 2] 🏥 Health check - Browser healthy
[After 50 duplicates] 🔄 Rotate to LA
[Hour 2-4] LA: Extract 60-90 ads
[Hour 4] 🏥 Health check - Browser healthy
[After 50 duplicates] 🔄 Rotate to Chicago
... continues indefinitely through all 40+ cities
```

## Testing The Fixes

### Verify SSE Fix:
1. Start unlimited extraction
2. Check server logs - should see much fewer broadcast messages
3. Client should still receive important updates (scan milestones, new ads)

### Verify URL Rotation:
1. Start unlimited extraction
2. Wait for "No new ads for 50 consecutive extractions"
3. Should see:
   ```
   🔄 ROTATING URL - No new ads for 50 extractions
   📍 Old: [old city]
   📍 New: [new city]
   ✅ Successfully rotated to new URL
   ```

### Verify Browser Health Check:
1. Let extraction run for 2+ hours
2. Should see:
   ```
   🏥 Performing browser health check (2h runtime)...
   ✅ Browser healthy - Current page: "..."
   💾 Memory: XXmb heap, XXmb total
   ```

## Configuration Options

### Adjust Rotation Threshold:
In `extractionWorker.js` line 1392:
```javascript
// Rotate after 50 failed attempts (current)
if (this.consecutiveNoNewAds >= 50) { ... }

// Rotate more frequently (25 attempts)
if (this.consecutiveNoNewAds >= 25) { ... }

// Rotate less frequently (100 attempts)
if (this.consecutiveNoNewAds >= 100) { ... }
```

### Adjust Health Check Interval:
In `extractionWorker.js` line 45:
```javascript
// Every 2 hours (current)
this.browserHealthCheckInterval = 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

// Every 1 hour
this.browserHealthCheckInterval = 1 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

// Every 4 hours
this.browserHealthCheckInterval = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
```

### Adjust Memory Limit:
In `extractionWorker.js` line 1294:
```javascript
// 500MB limit (current)
if (totalMB > 500) { ... }

// 1GB limit for more powerful servers
if (totalMB > 1000) { ... }

// 256MB limit for resource-constrained servers
if (totalMB > 256) { ... }
```

---

## Deployment

### Restart Server:
The changes require a server restart to take effect:

```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 restart newsbreak-crawler

# If using Docker
docker restart <container-name>

# If running directly
# Kill the existing process and restart
npm start
```

### No Database Changes Required:
All fixes are code-only, no schema migrations needed.

---

## Monitoring

### Check Logs For:
```
✅ Good Signs:
- "🔄 Rotated to new location"
- "✅ Browser healthy"
- "✨ Found X new ads"
- "📊 Total: X ads"

⚠️ Warning Signs:
- "❌ Too many consecutive errors"
- "⚠️ High memory usage detected"
- "❌ Browser not connected"

📊 Normal Operation:
- "🔍 Scan #XXXX"
- "No new ads found (all duplicates)" (before rotation)
- "💾 Memory: XXmb"
```
