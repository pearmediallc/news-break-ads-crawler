# 🚀 Render Deployment Fixes

## Issues Detected from Logs

1. ❌ **502 Bad Gateway** - Timeout during startup
2. ❌ **404 on extraction status** - Sessions lost on restart
3. ⚠️ **MemoryStore warning** - Not production-ready
4. ⚠️ **Multiple concurrent requests** - Overloading server

---

## 🛠️ Fixes to Apply

### 1. **Add Health Check Endpoint**

The health check is timing out. Need to ensure `/health` responds quickly.

### 2. **Fix Session Persistence**

Currently using in-memory sessions (lost on restart). Need persistent sessions.

### 3. **Optimize Render Configuration**

Increase startup timeout and add proper environment variables.

### 4. **Add Request Rate Limiting**

Too many concurrent requests causing 502 errors.

## Implementation Steps

Will create:
1. Health check endpoint that doesn't require database
2. Session persistence to database
3. Rate limiting middleware
4. Render-specific optimizations
